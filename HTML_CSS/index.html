			Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

		A Cascading Style Sheet is the website’s accessories. It’s responsible for outlining the colours, font and positioning of the content on a website. It adds some style and structure to the content. In order to make use of the CSS capabilities it needs to be linked within the HTML content so that style can be added to the website. CSS will tell the browser how to display the existing HTML.

		CSS can be compared to adding personal style to the body. When you link CSS to HTML, it’s like dressing up the body. For example, you can choose a specific colour shirt and match it with a specific colour pair of trousers. On a website, you can choose the colour of the background or the font size of a heading and much more. It’s important to note that CSS cannot live without HTML as there would be nothing to style. Just like clothes or shoes would be pointless without someone to wear them.

		So by now you should have an understanding of how structure and style are constructed on a website. A website that consists of HTML and CSS might looks like this:

		However, you can’t help but notice that something is missing. The web page is lacking certain functions like a search box or options to comment. Right now the body, with all its accessories, looks more like a mannequin in a store window than a real human being. That’s where JavaScript comes in.

		<h3>CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to specify the names of various style properties.
		A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block.</h3>

	<h3>Contents</h3>
	<p> Contents of the website Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any elements. An ID may only be applied to a single element.

    Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained in the document tree. One example of a widely used pseudo-class is :hover, which identifies content only when the user "points to" the visible element,</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">

	<h3>Syntax</h3>
	<p> Basic syntax of CSS. usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to a selector as in a:hover or #elementid:hover. A pseudo-class classifies document elements, such as :link or :visited, whereas a pseudo-element makes a selection that may consist of partial elements, such as ::first-line or ::first-letter.[6]

    Selectors may be combined in many ways to achieve great specificity and flexibility.[7] Multiple selectors may be joined in a spaced list to specify elements by location,</p>
	</div>

    <div class="block">

	<h3>Selectors</h3>
	<p> A style sheet consists of Selectors.type, id, class, or any combination thereof. The order of the selectors is important. For example, div .myClass {color: red;} applies to all elements of class myClass that are inside div elements, whereas .myClass div {color: red;} applies to all div elements that are inside elements of class myClass. This is not to be confused with concatenated identifiers such as div.myClass {color: red;} which applies to div elements of class myClass.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="block">

	<h3>Patterns</h3>
	<p> Usage of selectors In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.

	Selectors may apply to the following:

	all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2
	elements specified by attribute, in particular:
	id: an identifier unique within the document, identified with a hashprefix e.g. #id
	class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document, identified with a period prefix e.g. .classname</p>
